# About

**Nitter** is a free and open source alternative Twitter front-end focused on privacy.

This instance is running a build of **Nitter FT (Nitter Fast Track)**, a fork of the original project focused on serving new features, fixes, and code refractors in a rapid pace. The source is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/acarasimon96/nitter-ft>

## Features

* No JavaScript or ads
* All requests go through the backend, so that your browser never talks to Twitter
* Prevents Twitter from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
* Uses Twitter's unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)
* Lightweight (for [@nim_lang](/nim_lang), 60KB vs 784KB from twitter.com)
* RSS feeds
* Themes
* Clean, chronological home timeline of users you follow, without a Twitter account
* Mobile support (responsive design)
* AGPLv3 licensed: no proprietary instances permitted

Nitter's GitHub wiki contains
[instances](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances) and
[browser extensions](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Extensions)
maintained by the community.

## Why use Nitter?

It's basically impossible to use Twitter without JavaScript enabled. If you try,
you're redirected to the legacy mobile version which is awful both functionally
and aesthetically. For privacy-minded folks, preventing JavaScript analytics and
potential IP-based tracking is important, but apart from using the legacy mobile
version and a VPN, it's impossible.

Using an instance of Nitter (hosted on a VPS for example), you can browse
Twitter without JavaScript while retaining your privacy. In addition to
respecting your privacy, Nitter is on average around 15 times lighter than
Twitter, and in some cases serves pages faster.
